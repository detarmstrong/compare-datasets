Compare Datasets

Find discrepancies and commonalities between two CSV files using a matching key field on both datasets.

Compare Datasets works by loading your CSV files into a browser-based database (nothing is ever sent to a server) and then using SQL under the hood to join the datasets based on the user-defined common key field(s). The result is the join of the two tables - rows missing in either dataset are clearly shown in the results table for analysis. Use the venn filter options to limit view of the result set.
